Retro Notes:

1. What went well?
- Gordy - Andreas delivered a great main character, despite choosing a challenging model!
- Ryan - Was able to build a whole big game in 3 days
- Silas - Happy with everything coming together
- Silas - I was really impressed with the different divisions working autonomously
- Silas - Really enjoy the design elements of the game
- Ryan - Fully integrating with a team across timezones and with new people worked out smoothly
- Andreas - Overall coordination, the sheer scope of the game, team being very harmonic until the end
- NOM - We made a game! Good team spirit, everyone was well integrated and welcomed.
- Amerigo - Impressed with the amount of content! Also happy to see that most of my audio assets were successfully integrated :)

2. What didn't go well?
- Gordy - In spite of all the effort, near the end we were afraid we wouldn't have been able to ship a WebGL build
- Ryan - Didn't take Monday off work for the jam
- Silas - Miscommunicated the vision for the heroine with the Concept Art for the environment
- Silas - Juggling Design Lead & Project Manager led me to less smooth 48-hour mark deliverable
- Andreas - (Imho) We didnt predict the people not participaitng on monday and the ensuing velocity drop
- Andreas - I felt lost at times about the art direction and my deliverables and with whom to discuss specific topics
- NOM - FMOD caused issues with the web build. Not entirely clear that it was becuase of it or settings/filemanagement but it put spanners in the work.
- Amerigo - Had I been familiar with FMOD I may have been able adjust levels and dial in the audio a bit better

3. What lessons can we take moving forward?
- Gordy - If project manager is swamped with another role, delegate a lieutenant
- Gordy - Wants a Unity Build machine
- Gordy - Have an Fmod Template Fork or Unity Package
- Ryan - Take Monday off work to jam in the foxhole with the team
- Ryan - Prepare for the jam, the week before
- Silas - I'm not very capable of dialing in to casual mode
- Andreas - Better boilerplate + Unity integration scene to test every animation and transition + make sure not to trash the UVs
- Andreas - Will focus less exclusively on my own department and try to contribute more to the idea/design/visual departments
- NOM - Look at building the FMOD sound file differently or investigate using Wwise instead. Having more chatswith the code team early in the game so they can put in hooks for sound rather than me hacking in to their code.
- Getting more familiar with Unity and FMOD audio integration is a must

4. What was your personal favorite part of the jam?
- Gordy - Really enjoyed going to Isaac's house and hanging with the team!
- Gordy - Isaac's son, Caleb had some great questions about how the game was made
- Ryan - Playing the game with the team and showing it off!
- Ryan - The developer feeling of solving the water forced move
- Silas - The dungeon layout coming together at the 66 hours mark
- Andreas - Getting to work with a team THAT professional
- NOM - Great team leaders and direction, pro organisation, almost no gitpull heart palpatations...
- Looking for underwater sounding samples/sounds and seeing the full game come together at the end

5. What is your favorite thing in the game?
- Gordy - The main character model and animations are great! Magical!
- Silas - The fantastic story with the great twist, the mood-setting music, and the amazing environment art!
- Ryan - The gorgeous environment art!
- Andreas - The amount and the quality of stuff in the game!
- NOM - Just seeing and hearing the sound with the gameplay! The fast water works so well!
- Amerigo - I think the voiceover barks/taunts really add alot of flavor and bring the characters/world to life. Great work!
